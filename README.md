Use various terms to search the web or get direct feedback in your browser with this fun little app.

Some sample terms to use:

Open + website URL to open it in the browser (ex. open github.com)<br>
Google + your search topic (ex. Google cute puppies)<br>
YouTube + keyword to search directly in YouTube (ex. YouTube Shadowkai Gaming)<br>
Wiki + keyword to search directly in Wikipedia (ex. wiki Ruth Bader Ginsburg)<br>
'Time' displays the current time.<br>
'Date' displays the current date.

I will update this with more options in the future.
